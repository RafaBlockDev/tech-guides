# `4. Security Best Practices`

## ![‚úî] 4.1. Use Helmet

It protects your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities by setting HTTP headers appropriately.
Helmet is actually just a collection of smaller middleware functions that set security-related HTTP response headers, like:

- CSP (Content-Security-Policy) header to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
- hidePoweredBy removes the X-Powered-By header.
- ieNoOpen sets X-Download-Options for IE8+.

**Otherwise:** Your app will be vulnerable to some well known attacks.

## ![‚úî] 4.2. How to decide which Node.js version?

Don‚Äôt use deprecated or vulnerable versions of the framework you are using.
A good way to go is to always use the last stable version.

**Otherwise:** You could have security issues and no support working on them

# `5. Performance Best Practices`

## ![‚úî] 5.1. Use gzip compression

Gzip compressing can greatly decrease the size of the response body and hence increase the speed of a web app.

**Otherwise:** You could face long waiting times in large paylods/high-traffic web apps.

**GTK:** For a high-traffic website in production, the best way to put compression in place is to implement it at a reverse proxy level (see Use a reverse proxy). In that case, you do not need to use compression middleware.

## ![‚úî] 5.2. Do not use console.log

Not for the obvious reasons, but because console.log are synchronous when the destination is a terminal or a file, so they are not suitable for production, unless you pipe the output to another program.

**GTK:** Use a more mature logger like Winston or Bunyan

## ![‚úî] 5.3. Set NODE_ENV='production' for Production Environment (Express.js specific)

Setting NODE_ENV to ‚Äúproduction‚Äù makes Express:

- Cache view templates.
- Cache CSS files generated from CSS extensions.
- Generate less verbose error messages.
